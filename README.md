Timelapse of Crane Glacier 2015 - 2024
'Crane_2015_2024_Monthly_Movie.mp4' 
A timelapse image series was obtained from the Copernicus Browser (https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu) comprised of monthly Sentinel-1 images between January 2015 and January 2024. The timelapse illustrates the advance of Craneâ€™s ice front up to the time of the sea ice disintegration in January 2022, followed by rapid retreat and subsequent calving events thereafter.

Monthly Averaged Ice Flow Velocities 2022
'CraneVelocityResponse2022.avi'
The left-hand panel shows the monthly averaged 2D velocity field over the near terminus region of Crane and ambient sea ice throughout 2022. The right-hand panel shows the change in velocity from the labelled date compared to the average velocity from the corresponding month from when the sea ice remained intact (2015-2021). The percentage change in velocities across both the terminus and grounding line locations are displayed in the panel sub-title. Velocity data in both panels is overlain on Landsat satellite imagery where available, with the solid black line showing a representative terminus position for the corresponding month. The dashed black line shows the grounding line location based on the input bedrock and ice elevation profiles.
